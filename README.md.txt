PROJET 7 - Grandpy bot

This project is part of the Openclassroom's Python Developer path. Have a look at https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths for more information.

Brandpy is a bot developed in Python, which asks a user for a question about a location. It gives back the adress and a bit of history about that place, well, like grandpas usually do.

Have fun !
